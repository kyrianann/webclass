                <h2>Vatican speaks on abortion,LGBTQ rights,others.</h2>
             <img src="/img/defense bg4.jpg" alt="">
             <p>The Vatican on Monday published a new document setting out “grave violations of human dignity”, listing abortion, surrogacy and gender theory alongside discrimination against migrants and LGBTQ people. The 20-page document, endorsed by Pope Francis, is the culmination of five years of work but comes amid splits in the Catholic Entitled “Dignitas infinita” (Infinite dignity) and published by the Vatican’s powerful department of doctrine, the document covers the key themes of the Argentine’s 11-year papacy, from war to ecology and social justice. It reaffirms the Church’s long-held opposition to abortion, euthanasia and surrogacy, but now puts them alongside issues such as poverty, conflict, sexual abuse, marginalisation of migrants and human trafficking as “grave violations of human dignity”.

                “The new text thus contributes to overcoming the dichotomy that exists between those who focus exclusively on beginning-and-end-of-life issues, while forgetting so many other attacks against human dignity,” wrote Andrea Tornielli, editorial director of the Vatican’s communication department, in a commentary.
                
                It also speaks to those who “conversely… focus only on defending the poor and migrants while forgetting that life must be defended from conception to its natural conclusion”, he wrote.
                For the first time in such a specific way, the Vatican forcefully denounces gender theory, which broadly speaking is the idea that you do not have to adhere to the gender you were born with, and that gender is a product of societal norms, rather than purely biology.

               “Any sex-change intervention, as a rule, risks threatening the unique dignity the person has received from the moment of conception,” the document from the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith states.
                Elsewhere, the Vatican reasserts its opposition to the criminalisation of homosexuality, which still exists in many countries, particularly in Africa.</p>

                <h2>update: Nollywood actor junior pope dies</h2>
                <img src="/img/jnr.webp" alt="">
                <p>According to our source, Junior Pope died during a boat trip.

                    The boat capsized and he, alongside two other yet-to-be-identified actors, drowned. His body was recovered and rushed to the hospital, where he was confirmed dead.
                    
                    The Delta State Chairman of Actors Guild of Nigeria, AGN, Emma Onyemeziem, confirmed to Vanguard that the corpse had been deposited in the morgue. The death of Junior Pope is the latest in a string of tragedies that has hit Nollywood this year.

                    In January it was Deji Aderemi, popularly known as Olofa Ina. In February it was Ethel Ekpe. She is well known for playing the role of ‘Segi’ on the Nigerian Television Authority sitcom, ‘Basi and Company’.

                    <img src="/img/Bobrisky_1.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Controversial crossdresser, Okuneye Idris, aka Bobrisky, may spend the Eid-il-Fitri break in custody.

                    Bobrisky was arrested on April 3 and convicted by a Federal High Court sitting in Lagos on Friday, April 5, 2024, after pleading guilty to the charges of naira abuse levelled against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.
                    
                    The EFCC filed a six-count against Bobrisky, with the first four counts related to Naira abuse and the last two counts concerning alleged money laundering.</p>

                <p>Tinubu has felicitated the Muslim Ummah at Eid-el-Fitr, an auspicious occasion that signifies the end of Ramadan; a hallowed season which reflects total submission to God Almighty and to His command of sacrifice and service to humankind.

                The president greeted the Muslim faithful in Nigeria and all around the world, praying that their supplications and sacrifices this season and even after will receive the fitting rewards from Almighty Allah.
                
                As he emphasised during an iftar with Nigeria’s leaders of thought and conscience, President Tinubu appealed to all citizens to come together and rededicate themselves to the noble duty of building the nation, stating: “We are the sculptor, and Nigeria is the clay; we build it the way we desire”.</p>

            <h3>Total solar eclipse in north America</h3>
                <p>Eclipse mania gripped all of Mexico, the U.S. and Canada, as the moon swept in front of the sun, blotting out daylight. Almost everyone in North America was guaranteed at least a partial eclipse, weather permitting.

                Street lights blinked on and the planets came into view, as the moon shrouded the sun for a few minutes across the land. Dogs howled, frogs croaked and some people wept, all part of the eclipse mania gripping Mexico, the U.S. and Canada.
                            
                It was the continent’s biggest eclipse audience ever, with a couple hundred million people living in or near the shadow’s path, plus scores of out-of-towners flocking in to see it. With the next coast-to-coast eclipse 21 years out, the pressure was on to catch this one.
                            
                Clouds blanketed most of Texas as the total solar eclipse began its diagonal dash land, starting along Mexico’s mostly clear Pacific coast and aiming for Texas and 14 other U.S. states, before exiting into the North Atlantic near Newfoundland.
                            
                In Georgetown, Texas, the skies cleared just in time to give spectators a clear view. In other spots, the eclipse played peek-a-boo with the clouds.
                            
                “We are really lucky,” said Georgetown resident Susan Robertson. “Even with the clouds it is kind of nice, because when it clears up, it is like, Wow!”</p>

                <h2>Men still want me at age 59-Rita Edochie</h2>
                <img src="/img/trending2.jpg" alt="">
                <p>In her Facebook post, she claimed that even at her old age, men are still showing interest in her.

                    “Men were crazy about me but trust Ijele, I was very selective because I needed to get the best man that deserved me and at age 22, my great husband came. Tony Edochie came my way and I quickly grabbed him because he was the only man that deserved me.
                    
                    “The shocking thing is that at my current age now, men still love to have me, I’m hotter than fire, I’m a correct babe.
                    
                    
                    “Yet I still didn’t snatch what wasn’t mine but people that their breasts are bigger than their body will rush to claim someone’s else’s property and they wouldn’t allow us to hear words on social media”.</p>
