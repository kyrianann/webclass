                <h3>GOVERNMENT</h3>
                <h3 ><b>LAGS to demolish $200 million landmark beach resort for costal highway project.</b></h3>
                <p>The lagos state government is set to demolish a portion of the popular landmark beach resort to
                    give
                    way for the coastal highway construction of the lagos-calabar road project. 
                    Landmark Beach Resort’s management has initiated negotiations with federal and state governments
                    and
                    interest groups to adjust the initial 1.5 km segment of the Lagos-Calabar Coastal Highway,
                    proposing
                    to redirect it along the undeveloped median of Water Corporation Road to avoid disrupting the
                    resort’s business.

                    Paul Onwuanibe, CEO of Landmark Africa Group, made this announcement on his official X (formerly
                    Twitter) account on Saturday in response to a demolition notice from the Lagos State Government,
                    which targeted the resort for being in the planned right of way of the highway, negotiations are
                    underway to reroute the initial segment of the Lagos-Calabar Coastal Highway and protect the
                    resort’s location.

                    “I wish to confirm that we are in active talks with various arms of the federal and state
                    government
                    including the Lagos State Government, the Federal and State Ministries of Tourism, and the
                    Federal
                    Ministry of Works and Housing as well as several interest groups and have received firm
                    assurances
                    that there will be no disruptions to business while we work to agree win-win solutions including
                    rerouting the first 1.5 km out of the 700km stretch of the Road to its original location along
                    the
                    undeveloped Water Corporation Road median.
                    “We believe that with careful collaboration and consultation, a small number of other minor
                    reroutes
                    may be required to sustain the existing socioeconomic activity along the course of this Road,”
                    Onwuanibe’s post read in part.”
                    The CEO of Landmark Africa Group commended the Lagos-Calabar Coastal Highway project for its
                    potential to boost the economy and expressed optimism about the ongoing consultations.

                    Onwuanibe believes that these discussions will find ways to develop the road while preserving
                    the
                    Landmark Group’s ecosystem.

                    According to him, this ecosystem not only contributes billions of Naira in annual taxes and
                    employs
                    thousands of Nigerians but also provides a range of corporate, leisure, hospitality, and tourism
                    services to over 3 million local and international visitors each year.</P>

            <p>The Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, said the Federal Government is still paying subsidy on electricity despite the recent hike in tariff paid by Band A customers.

                Adelabu stated this in an interview on Channels Television’s Politics.Adelabu said the tariff hike only affects 1.5 million customers — out of 12 million.
                The tariff is flexible and I can tell you that even if naira gains more and the exchange rate comes down below N1,000, it must positively affect the tariff.</p>
